          Common Myths vs Reality
        </h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Myth:</strong> I don't need to worry about commissions
            because the seller covers them.<br />
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Today, buyers must often pay their agents
            directly, and commissions are part of the offer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Myth:</strong> Commissions are negotiable, so it’s easy to
            get a better deal.<br />
            <strong>Reality:</strong> While commissions are negotiable, strong
            pressure keeps them close to traditional levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Myth:</strong> I'll be treated the same whether or not I
            have an agent.<br />
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Some sellers and agents still favor buyers
            who offer full commissions.
