          Behind-the-Scenes: Steering and Incentives
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Many agents steer clients toward homes with higher commissions and
          discourage offers where commission is reduced. For example, on a
          $500,000 home, 3% equals $15,000 — often financed through your
          mortgage, costing you even more over time.
