    <h1>Take Control of Your Home Buying Journey</h1>
    <p>
      For decades, U.S. real estate commissions have been entrenched at 5–6%.
      Recent lawsuits are starting to create change, but most buyers still don’t
      know they have options.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Myths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <button onclick="toggleExplanation('myth1')">
          You must use a real estate agent to make an offer.
        </button>
        <p id="myth1" style="display: none">
          Reality: You can submit offers directly or through an attorney.
          HomePilot walks you through this step if you choose to go agent-free.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <button onclick="toggleExplanation('myth2')">
          Sellers always pay the agent fees.
        </button>
        <p id="myth2" style="display: none">
          Reality: Buyers typically finance the commission through their
          mortgage. HomePilot helps you understand these hidden costs.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <button onclick="toggleExplanation('myth3')">
          The 3% commission is standard and non-negotiable.
        </button>
        <p id="myth3" style="display: none">
          Reality: Commissions are negotiable by law — HomePilot shows you how
          to explore flat fees or negotiate rates.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <button onclick="toggleExplanation('myth4')">
          You’ll get the same access and priority when buying without an agent.
        </button>
        <p id="myth4" style="display: none">
          Reality: Many agents discourage or ignore offers from unrepresented
          buyers. HomePilot helps you navigate around those gatekeepers with
          tools that put you in control.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Behind-the-Scenes: Steering and Incentives</h2>
    <p>
      Many agents steer clients toward homes with higher commissions and
      discourage offers where commission is reduced. For example, on a $500,000
      home, 3% equals $15,000 — often financed through your mortgage, costing
      you even more over time.
    </p>
