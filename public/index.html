      Today, buyers are often asked to sign agreements where they commit to
      paying a 2.5–3% commission — sometimes before they even choose a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      While commissions are now negotiable in theory, in practice many buyers
      and sellers still face pressure to stick to outdated norms.

      HomePilot gives you the tools to see your real options, negotiate fairly,
      and control your home buying journey. <a href="/learn-more">Learn how</a>.
