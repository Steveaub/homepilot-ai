# HomePilot AI — Operations Workflow

## Strategic Layer (Brain)

**ChatGPT Projects**

- Role: Strategist, Architect, and Centralized Memory.
- Purpose: Organize all ideas, technical planning, documentation, and prompt refinement.
- Method: Every major decision, brainstorm, and update is recorded here first.

**Gemini 2.5**

- Role: Research Assistant and Alternate Strategist.
- Purpose: Used selectively for expanding knowledge, stress-testing architectural decisions, and exploring alternative approaches.

## Execution Layer (Hands)

**GitHub Copilot Agent (VS Code)**

- Role: Engineer/Executor.
- Purpose: Executes only _refined_, _strategic_, _pre-validated_ prompts from the Strategic Layer.
- Principle: No unrefined prompting. Only precise instructions.

# Development Principles

- **Speed with Discipline**: Rapid iteration without sacrificing clarity or architectural integrity.
- **Minimized Technical Debt**: Every build action ties directly to a documented plan.
- **High-Fidelity Output**: Prompts are refined to maximize the quality of Copilot Agent's output.
- **Compounding Velocity**: Centralized memory (Projects) + Focused Execution (Agent) multiplies iteration speed compared to traditional workflows.

This operating model allows HomePilot AI to function like a lean startup team — maximizing speed, minimizing waste, and focusing relentlessly on product-market fit.
