# 🏠 HomePilot AI — Operations Workflow

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines HomePilot AI’s operating system for maximizing development velocity, minimizing technical waste, and ensuring alignment between strategic thinking and tactical execution.  
By clearly separating Strategic Layer (brain) and Execution Layer (hands), HomePilot AI operates with startup-level speed and discipline.

## 🧠 Strategic Layer (Brain)

**ChatGPT Projects**  
- **Role**: Strategist, Architect, and Centralized Memory.  
- **Purpose**: Organize all ideas, technical planning, documentation, and prompt refinement.  
- **Method**: Every major decision, brainstorm, and system update is recorded here first before execution.

**Gemini 2.5**  
- **Role**: Research Assistant and Alternate Strategist.  
- **Purpose**: Used selectively to expand research scope, stress-test architectural decisions, and explore alternative approaches when needed.

## 🛠️ Execution Layer (Hands)

**GitHub Copilot Agent (VS Code)**  
- **Role**: Engineer/Executor.  
- **Purpose**: Executes only _refined_, _strategic_, _pre-validated_ prompts issued from the Strategic Layer.  
- **Principle**: No unrefined or exploratory prompting. Copilot Agent receives precise, ready-to-build instructions.

## 📋 Development Principles

- **Speed with Discipline**  
  ➔ Rapid iteration while maintaining clarity, planning discipline, and architectural integrity.
  
- **Minimized Technical Debt**  
  ➔ Every development action ties directly to a documented and validated strategic plan.

- **High-Fidelity Output**  
  ➔ Prompts are refined to maximize quality, minimize rework, and ensure smooth CI/CD integration later.

- **Compounding Velocity**  
  ➔ Centralized Strategic Memory (ChatGPT Projects) + Focused Execution (Copilot Agent) creates a compounding effect on iteration speed compared to traditional ad-hoc workflows.

## 🛡️ Operating Model Summary

HomePilot AI functions like a lean, high-velocity startup team:  
- **Minimizing system drag** through deliberate structure.  
- **Maximizing speed and flexibility** without sacrificing product-market fit exploration.  
- **Compounding institutional memory** through documented strategic refinement cycles.
