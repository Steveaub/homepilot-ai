# Copilot Agent Execution Template

## Role

Act as a [Role Here] experienced in [Tech Stack Here].

## Goal

[Write a 1-2 sentence user story explaining what the user wants and why.]

## Feature

[Explain clearly what new functionality should be added or changed. Include inputs, outputs, important interactions.]

## Constraints

- Maintain system stability and project structure.
- Preserve all existing core flows unless improvement is required.
- Modify as many files as necessary to achieve clean integration.
- Follow existing code patterns, linting rules (e.g., ESLint, Prettier), and naming conventions.
- If needed, create or update relevant unit/integration tests.
- Manage dependencies properly; only add necessary libraries.
- Implement with security best practices in mind (e.g., input validation, error handling).
- Perform the work assuming it happens inside a new Git branch (e.g., feature/your-feature-name).

## Non-Goals

[State anything out of scope (e.g., do not refactor unrelated modules like auth, reporting, billing, etc.).]

## Expected Outcome (Acceptance Criteria)

[Write a list of 5â€“8 bullet points describing the exact success criteria. What must exist on screen? What must happen in the backend? What must pass in tests?]
