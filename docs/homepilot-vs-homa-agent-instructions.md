# HomePilot AI Agent Instructions - Competitive Context: Homa

## Overview

This compares HomePilot AI and Homa based on business models, user workflows, AI capabilities, regulatory risk, and scalability. It guides HomePilot AI's differentiation strategy to ensure superior product-market fit.

## Business Model Comparison

HomePilot AI offers AI-guided home buying task management and an agent marketplace without acting as a fiduciary, using API-driven expert referrals. Homa offers a DIY homebuying assistant with planned $100 access fee.

## Workflow Comparison

HomePilot uses 'Paste-to-Parse' for listings, step-by-step AI guidance, and expert referral paths. Homa focuses on data analysis, disclosure scanning, and basic offer generation with lighter escalation.

## AI Capabilities Comparison

Both offer 24/7 AI support and offer calculation. HomePilot AI adds escalation triggers and marketplace integration for additional services.

## Regulatory Risk

Both platforms avoid brokerage licensing and fiduciary duty. HomePilot AI emphasizes task-based guidance to reduce risk further.

### Modern Realty Positioning

Modern Realty co-founder has publicly stated that they are "not necessarily trying to uproot the industry," but instead seek to enhance the real estate buying experience by supporting agents. This positions Modern Realty primarily as a workflow optimization tool for agents rather than a disruptor of the agent-driven model. In contrast, HomePilot AI is focused on empowering buyers directly, offering an alternative to the traditional agent-centric approach and reducing structural barriers to homeownership.

## Strategic Advantages for HomePilot AI

- Comprehensive task management
- Expert referrals via API
- Aggressive edge case handling
- Paste-to-Parse technology
- Financial empowerment focus

## Conclusion

While Homa validates the DIY AI homebuying model, HomePilot AI empowers buyers with richer workflows, expert referrals at critical points, and full process control, positioning itself as a full strategic homebuying manager rather than just an assistant.
